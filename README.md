# AWS Content Moderation Constructs for CDK

This repository contains deployment automation for building content moderation pipelines across audio, video, text, and arbitrary documents sources. It provides these capabilities as extensions to the AWS CDK.

The [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

It offers a high-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively using the power of modern programming languages. Using the CDKâ€™s library of infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic.
